# Hello World

*   A list item with a blockquote:

    > This is a blockquote
    > inside a list item.
    >
    >     testing
    >         Hello World
    >     end % testing

This is a normal paragraph:

    This is a code block.

Or we can `write` some `code` commands.

```MATLAB
XX = linspace(0,2*pi);
YY = zeros(size(XX));
for ii=1:length(XX)
  YY(ii) = sin(XX(ii));
end % for ii
```

This page doesn't use the deault layout (not sure why) but Here is a link to
[new](/new/) which does.

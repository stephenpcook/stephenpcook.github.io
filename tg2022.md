COSTUME SUGGESTIONS-visit [https://davekki.com/flexi](https://davekki.com/flexi) to find out more

 1. BLANCHE BATTERS Your pinafore and apron are dusted with flour (like the rest of you).  You're always hot and bothered so keep your hair covered and your sleeves rolled to show off your tattoos!
 2. CINDERS Your maid's uniform comprises black dress, white apron and fishnets but sometimes you're just more comfortable in your rags.  Either way, you're never without your feather duster.
 3. DEE MINOR You're dressed to perform in a simple but striking cocktail dress rebelliously paired with leggings and avant garde footwear.  You love to wear musically themed accessories.
 4. EM FATALE With smouldering eyes, red lips, and dress that looks like it was poured on, you're always dressed to kill.  A stylish clutch purse completes the look.
 5.  MISTY VISIONS You're a free spirit in floaty fabrics, adorned with scarves, belts, bangles and big earrings.  You're often seen lis- tening to unseen forces or force-reading strangers' palms.
 6.  MRS WITHERING Your old-fashioned high-necked black dress is perfect for a woman in your position.  You keep your hair neatly tied in a bun but soften the look with an antique silver locket.
 7.  SIERRA TANGO Your knee-length black skirt, black tights and white blouse give you that 'officer on the beat' look, but those shoes don't look regulation.  You're happy to demonstrate proper use of the handcuffs and baton that you carry at all times.
 8. THE BUTLER Smartly dressed in immaculate suit tails and white gloves, you're rarely seen without a little silver tray, polishing cloth, and superior sneer.
 9. DOCTOR FUMBLES Your white coat, stethoscope and pocketful of tongue depressors are all you need to play doctor- oh, as well as an alarming collection of pointy instruments.
 10. FORD ESCORT You wear the formal chauffeur's uniform of grey suit and cap but have (fuel) injected it with driving gloves, moustache and aviator sunglasses.  And your lucky fluffy dice, of course.
 11. GENERAL CUSTARD You're not in the military any more, but that doesn't stop you wearing your Army uniform, complete with medals.  You always stand to attention with the help of a metal tipped walking stick.
 12. INSPECTOR DENAUX When not in disguise, you blend into the crowd with trilby hat, trench coat and mous- tache.  A newspaper and magnifying glass give you something to hide behind if needed.
 13. PROFESSOR PEACOCK Tweed jacket, leather elbow pads, glasses and an armful of textbooks show you've got your academic on.  Brown corduroy trousers and last year's Christmas jumper complete your Look.
 14. REVEREND WILL BEEDONE You pair the traditional black shirt and dog collar with jeans to show you're hip and trendy.  Your thick woollen cardigan keeps the church draughts out and you always have the Good Book to hand - or at least, a good book.
